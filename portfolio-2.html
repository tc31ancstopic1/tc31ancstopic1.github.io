					<h2>What are Automatic Direction Finder(ADF) used for</h2>
					<p>Automatic Direction finder (ADF) is a navigational instrument found on an aircraft . It helps the pilot to know which direction the aircraft should be heading. The ADF consist of 4 main parts which are control unit , antenna ,  receiver unit and the display unit . In the ADF display unit consist of the a rotating compass card and an arrow pointing to the current non directional beacon (NDB) . The ADF navigation system uses low and medium frequency band to find the NDB from 190KHz to 535KHz .The receiver unit will received the electromagnetic wave signal from the NDB . The signal is usually amplitude modulated .When the receiver demodulate the signal , it will produce an audio tone of a 3 letter morse code to let the pilot identify the correct NDB  . On the aircraft itself the ADF navigation system consist of 2 antenna . They are the loop antenna and the sense antenna . The loop antenna is an inductive antenna and it usually mounted at the belly of the aircraft  . The sense antenna is a capacitive antenna and it usually mounted at the top of the aircraft . The 2 antenna will combine the signal together to form a cardiod like signal with one null point  .This null point is used to point the arrow of the display unit . The control unit of the ADF is used to tune the receiver to the correct NDB frequency .</p>
					<p>Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) is an electronic navigation assist that identifies an aircraft's relative bearing from an MF or LF bandwidth radio beacon, such as a non-directional beacon or a commercial radio broadcasting station. </p>
					<p>ADF basically consists of an aerial circle that is physically or electronically rotated and senses the direction of minimal transmission from the beacon relative to the direction of the aircraft. Alternatively, the aircraft equipment incorporates the relative bearing with heading information from the aircraft compass to produce bearing direction lines that can be plotted on a map. This information can be used specifically with the home of the beacon.</p>

			  <h2>What are Very high frequency Omni-directional Range(VOR) used for</h2>
			  <p>Very high frequency Omni-directional range (VOR) is a navigation system on the aircraft that provide directional information to the pilot . It uses very high frequency band from 108MHz to 111.95MHz . The VOR navigation system consist of 4 parts . They are the control unit , antenna , display unit and the receiver unit .The receiver will received the frequency modulated signal form the non directional beacon.Once demodulated , it will produce a 3 letter morse code to pilot to identify if the pilot is on the correct NDB .  There are 4 elements on the VOR display . They are the rotating compass card , omni bearing selector , course deviation indicator and the TO- FROM  indicator . The rotating compass card can be rotated using the omni bearing selector .The course deviation indicator is the vertical bar on the VOR display that swing left and right along the deviation bar .This is to tell the pilot whether if the aircraft is aligned with the NDB . The TO-FROM indicator tells the pilot if the aircraft is flying toward or away from the NDB.</p>

				<h2>What are Instrument Landing System (ILS) used for</h2>
				<p>Instrument landing system(ILS) is a type of navigation system that is used for landing the aircraft . It is also known as precision runway approach and it use for horizontal and vertical guidance for pilot to land aircraft on the runway.The vertical guidance is called localiser and the horizontal guidance is called glide slope. The localizer and glideslope produce signal that is similar to the function of VOR.Both VOR and ILS operates at very high frequency band from 108MHz to 119.95MHz.The difference lies in the ground station and the channel used .The glideslope and localizer is tune to the frequency of the runway instead of the non directional beacon.The glideslope and localizer uses odd channels while the VOR uses even channels  .The localizer provide azithmuth guidance to the pilot while the glideslope provide elevation guidance to the pilot .The localizer usually found at the end of a runway and transmit 2 beams that are intersecting . One of the beam is to the right of the runway while the other beam is to the left of runway .The glideslope is usually found at the aerodrome and also transmit 2 beams that are intersecting . one is above the required vertical profile while the other beam is below the required vertical profile.</p>
				<p>The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is characterized as a precise runway approach assist based on two radio beams that together provide vertical and horizontal guidance to pilots during land access.</p>
				<p>An Instrument Landing System is a precision runway approach assist that uses two radio beams to provide vertical and horizontal guidance to pilots on the approach to landing. Azimuth guidance is provided by the localizer (LOC), while the proper vertical descent profile is specified by the glideslope (GS).</p>
				<p>Marker beacons and high-intensity runway lights may still be provided as aids for the use of an ILS, but the former are now more likely to have been replaced, for example with a VOR, by a DME integral to the ILS or elsewhere positioned on the airfield.</p>

			  <h2>What are Global Positioning Sustem (GPS) used for</h2>
			  <p>Global positioning system (GPS) is a form of navigation system that uses satellite system, receivers and ground station. GPS is divided into 3 sections. They are space, user and control. The space segment contain 21 satellite each orbiting on its own around the earth at 11,000 NM above. The user segment contain a receiver on the aircraft for pilot to use the GPS. The control segment consist of ground station to make sure that the GPS is working properly as intended. The aircraft GPS system uses NAVSTAR satellite. It will transmit signal constantly from one satellite to another to find the location of the aircraft. The satellite can transmit 2 types of carrier signals 1575.42MHz which is for civilian use and 1227.6MHz which is for military use. When the aircraft GPS receiver received the signal from the satellite, it will calculate the time taken for the signal to transmit from one satellite to another can find the location of the aircraft with reference from the satellite position. </p>
